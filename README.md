Evercell

Front-end repository. Please make sure to download the backend if you intend to run it.

Evercell is a simple game Player vs Player I've created to explore WebSockets technology. Utilizing React's virtual DOM and states combined with Ruby on Rails on the backend and ActionCable allowed me to create this multiplayer player vs player game.

Requires:
Ruby 2.5+
Rails 5.2
React 16

## INSTRUCTIONS ##
1. Download both the evercell-frontend and evercell-backend repositories.
2. Sart the backend on port 5000 (rails server -p 5000).
3. Start the frontend on port 3000 (npm start).
4. Login to the game.
